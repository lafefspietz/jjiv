# Cold Box Standoff

![](images/cold-box-standoff-qrcode.png)

This brass machined part connects the [H Bracket](../h-bracket/) in the JJIV system with the [cold sample box](../cold-sample-box/) by way of two lenghts of 4-40 brass screws.  In order to order this you will need the .pdf and .step files below.  We had prototypes machined by [pcbway.com](https://pcbway.com) in the spring of 2024.  

These will be made available on artists' web pages to get economies of scale
