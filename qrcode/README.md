# QR Codes

We generate the QR codes for each element of this set of objects using programs written in JavaScript which use the [qrcode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) library.  This library can be called from the [CDN(content delivery network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) at Cloudflare using the following code in an html file:

```
   <script src = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/qrcodejs/1.0.0/qrcode.min.js"></script>
```
