# [M4 H Bracket](https://github.com/lafefspietz/jjiv/tree/main/h-bracket)

This H Bracket is designed for a maximally flexible way to mount experiments in a dilution refrigerator. It is common in dilution refrigerators for there to be arrays of M4 threaded holes in both the mixing chamber and 4 kelvin plates. 

The H bracket can be slid around and mounted in any orientation or position in these arrays using a pair of M4 screws, which generally come with the dilution refrigerator.  

The H bracket is so named because it resembles the capital letter "H".

Several of these were ordered from PcbWay in the spring of 2024 at NIST.  In our initial design, however, we mistakenly designed the slots for M3 screws and had to modify them in the machine ship after the fact. 

These brackets are designed to be connected to the rest of an experiment via quarter inch 4-40 socket cap screws like the [brass ones from McMaster here](https://www.mcmaster.com/57185A11/). The screws are inset into the holes so that heads disappear, allowing the bracket to sit flush against the plate in the fridge with the heads facing the plate.
