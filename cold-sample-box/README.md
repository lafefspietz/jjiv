# Cold Sample Box

This metal box closes directly over the bare copper on the circuit board, and the soldermask covering the lines going into the sample space.  There is about 1 mm vertical distance in the cavity where the samples are placed.  RF absorbent foam can be used over the RC line filters in the [cold sample board](../cold-sample-board-rev2/) to further block very high frequency signals. 

This enclosure aims to be a very cold and dark space with effective heat sinking to the base of a dilution refrigerator.  The two parts are held together with 2-56 screws, and are attached to the [cold box standoff](../cold-box-standoff/) by 4-40 screws.  

We had the prototypes built out of brass by [PCBWay.com](https://pcbway.com) in the spring of 2024, and are testing them now over the summer of 2024.  To order them from any machine shop, you will need the .pdf and the .step files below.  You need to get both a top and a bottom for each JJIV kit.  Also listed below are the screws you need to assemble everything and the hex wrenches for those screws. It's always a good idea to add those hex wrenches to your parts order so you don't have to hunt for those sizes during assembly.

These can be bought and sold by artists on the Internet as well, to take advantage of economies of scale from the machine shop.
